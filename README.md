# A/B Testing User Retention

Business Problem:
Cookie cats is a game and as the players progress through the game, they are encouraged and to make in-app purchases. This A/B test will analyze the result of users when they move from gate 30 to gate 40 and understand the retention of players through game rounds
In part one of this notebook, we conduct some exploratory data analysis looking at the relationship between retention variable and the user database. It was seen that over 3900 users downloaded the app but never played the game and as the level progressed, number of users and engagement went down. This analysis helps leadership understand consumer behaviour and strategize marketing initiatives to increase the retention ratio after 1 and 7 days of installing the game.

**Steps Taken**
1. Loading the data
2. Exploring relationship between variables
3. Testing data for OLS assumptions 
4. Performing A/B testing on the two groups 

**Tools Used:**
1. Python

**Learnings:**
1. Independently setting up A/B tests
2. Testing data for OLS Assumptions 

**In next step:**
1. Add more data to get better results 
2. Add other variables like in-app promotions
